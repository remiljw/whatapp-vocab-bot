# whatapp-vocab-bot

This is a whatsapp bot built with Flask and integrated with Twilio whatsapp sandbox.
It is a dictionary, it provides you meaning/examples/synonyms/antonyms of words. Data is gotten from Thesaurus API. 

To test is quite simple, but because my sandbox is on free tier, you would first have to send 'join chosen-card' to the whatsapp bot.Once that is done, send 'help' and you are good to go.
